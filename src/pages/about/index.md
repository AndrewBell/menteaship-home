### Goal

menTEAship aims to build supportive and inclusive environments for developers of all skill ranges to discuss career goals, share perspectives, and mentor one another. 

### Meetup

Meeting once a month for tea, coffee, and discussion, the men_tea_ship uses a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) format to spur conversation. All are welcome to this free event. Join our [mailing list](http://email.mentaship.com) to be notified for the next event.

### Community

You can chat with us anytime on the [STLTech](https://stltech.org/) Slack in the #mentaship channel.
